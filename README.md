# ![icon](https://github.com/mstuyts/Plugin-Load-Times/blob/master/PluginLoadTimes/icon.png?raw=true) "Plugin Load Times" for [QGIS](http://qgis.org)
*This plugin shows the latest load time of each plugin (QGIS startup, plugin installation,...). It does not give you information about the speed of plugins when they are used.*

This plugin adds a toolbar button and an item to the plugin menu to see how long each plugin loads during QGIS startup. It shows the QGIS python variable *[qgis.utils.plugin_times](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/b1b647349ac5d43a6f0b1a308dd7480f11dded63/python/utils.py#L358)* in an easy to understand window. It's possible to sort the results based on plugin name or on load time.

**"PluginLoadTimes"** works in *QGIS 2.x* (2.14 and newer) and *QGIS 3.x*.  

**"Plugin Load Times" for QGIS is also available in the [Official QGIS Plugin Repository](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/PluginLoadTimes/). You can install it from within [QGIS](http://qgis.org).**

This QGIS plugin is inspired by a [Stack Exchange question](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/209129/how-to-tell-which-qgis-plugins-are-slow-to-load/209131).

If you use the plugin and notice a problem with it, please [report a bug](https://github.com/mstuyts/Plugin-Load-Times/issues).
